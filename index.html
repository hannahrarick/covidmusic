      <p>As the country continues its stop-and-go efforts to restart the economy and recover from its coronavirus-induced state of paralysis, government officials are hoping the industries that were impacted by the pandemic will start to rebound.</p>

      <p>But for those in the arts — from those just starting out to those well into their careers — it could be a long time before things return to normal.</p>

      <p>Live performances have been canceled or postponed. Large gatherings are restricted. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, full-time musicians have been forced to scramble for other jobs in the quest of a steady income.</p>

      <p>Someone who’s had luck performing during the pandemic this year is no other than Abby Young. </p>

      <p>Young, 30, is a violinist, personnel manager for Nu Deco Ensemble and is the managing director of the Henri Mancini Institute at the University of Miami's Frost School of Music.</p>

      <p>As coronavirus restrictions in Florida eased up this fall, Young said she felt fortunate to perform with Nu Deco Ensemble at the North Beach Bandshell. With the Nu Deco Ensemble, Young has worked with Wyclef Jean, PJ Morton, Jacob Collier and Macy Gray.</p>

			<p>Young started the year off hot, as she was able to share the stage and perform with Shakira during the Super Bowl LIV halftime show. She was slated to perform with Kygo at Ultra Music Festival in downtown Miami in March, but the festival was postponed to 2021 amid fear of the coronavirus.</p>

			<p>Everything performance-wise was limited for Young during quarantine. Young said some of her friends and colleagues would ask her to record from home to help them with their projects, and she had a few people hire her to play for their relatives' birthdays.</p>

			<p>On top of live streaming, Young has been hosting private violin lessons via Zoom throughout the duration of the pandemic. Some of her students have taken breaks from her lessons because they aren’t comfortable with virtual learning.</p>

			<p>Johnny Hayes has been playing bass since 2014 for the South Florida Red-Hot-Chilli-Peppers-meets-Dave-Matthews band Rogue Theory.</p>

			<p>Over the past few months, he started a state job as a firefighter and a part-time music teacher, too — to make up the income lost from live performances that were canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p>But, he said, even with the additional gigs, his income still isn't adding up to what he made in The Before Time.</p>

			<p>“I have a daughter now, and I wanted to make sure that I had benefits for her because being a musician doesn’t come with benefits,” Hayes, 31, said. “If I didn't get the state job, then I'd be in the same boat as everyone else.”</p>

      <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues to reorder society and leave the future of live performances with no guarantees, Hayes is one of the thousands of independent musicians in Florida who are desperately trying to protect themselves from financial ruin.</p>

      <p>“There was a stretch where I was lucky if I had a gig every other month,” Hayes said. “Now it's starting to pick back up a little bit and realistically, I'm averaging three to five a month.”</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/this-is-how-covid-19-is-affecting-the-music-industry" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>, artists generate about 75 percent of their income from live shows. Physical sales of recorded music revenue are down by about one-third, while digital sales have fallen around 11 percent.</p>

      <p>A six-month shutdown is estimated to cost the music industry over $10 billion in sponsorships, with longer delays being even more devastating.</p>

      <p>Danny Guaico, 28,  a musician and singer-songwriter in Miami, began working on his debut project back in February but had to hold off for two months after everything shut down in March. Guaico set up a GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-finish-recording-my-ep?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet" target="_blank">fundraiser</a> to help pay for studio time in hopes of finishing his project by the end of this year. He’s raised $135 of his $1,000 goal so far.</p>

      <p>Guaico currently works part time as a barista at Walt Grace Vintage in Wynwood, where business isn’t anywhere near as busy as it was before the pandemic hit he said.</p>

      <p>“It’s slow as hell,” Guaico said. “It picks up on weekends because Miami locals are out in Wynwood, but it slows down during the week because of the lack of tourism.”</p>

      <p>Tourists are really what keep everything afloat, he added.</p>

      <p>Janna Pelle, 30, a freelance creative communications consultant, musician and producer, moved from Brooklyn to Miami in March when the pandemic was forcing everything to shut down, only to move back to New York just five months later after coronavirus cases were becoming overbearing in Miami.</p>

      <p>Pelle is a classically trained pianist and according to Tune Groover, a blog based in Gainesville, Florida, is “the lovechild of Fiona Apple and Lady Gaga with the alter-ego of David Byrne.”</p>

      <p>With the help of her friend Alex Cohen and Leo Freire, drummer for Wheatus, Pelle began learning how to play drums right before quarantine.</p>

			<p>Since her move to Glen Spey, New York, Pelle has been using her time during the pandemic to self-produce her next album for the first time while also creating a new sound and style for herself. While she has been doing virtual performances, her main focus has been producing.</p>

			<p>“I’ve always worked with producers before but now I’m spending time learning how to produce, mix and do everything myself,” Pelle said. “I’m really becoming a one-woman-show and although I haven’t shown that to an audience yet, that’s okay.”</p>

      <p>Despite Pelle’s focus on producing her next album, she does miss live shows as she hasn’t performed in front of an audience in over a year.</p>

      <p>Last November, towards the end of her college career, Giovanna Genta, 21, decided to pursue music professionally. But like all starting musicians, she couldn’t do it professionally without getting her first deal. Then the pandemic hit.</p>

      <p>“I’m just a starting artist and during COVID, artists make their money through three main streams, which are streaming — which is very minimal — touring and merchandise,” Genta said.  “As an artist who’s still building her brand, I’m not really selling merchandise like that, and I’m not touring because of COVID.”</p>

    <div class="parallax-text-container">
      <p>Currently, Genta is working as an English-as-a-Second-Language teacher online because it is something that she can do remotely while she is in Los Angeles or when she is traveling and doing recording sessions.</p>

      <p>Genta stated that social media and virtual concerts have been a huge help to artists who can continue putting out content to keep their fans engaged.</p>

      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.aec-music.eu/userfiles/File/customfiles/messick2020musicindustryincrisis-1_20201002111902.pdf" target="_blank">research article</a> by Kyle Messick, the National Independent Venue Association concluded that as many as 90 percent of music venues across the United States would permanently close.</p>

      <p>After talking to a number of managers while she was in Los Angeles, Genta said live performances would likely be held off until fall 2021, though she has heard that there are going to be music festivals by mid-next year.</p>

			<p>According to the World Economic Forum, the coronavirus pandemic is likely to accelerate underlying trends in the music industry and the importance of streaming, which has grown from 9 percent to 47 percent of total industry revenues in just six years.</p>

			<p>With music venues not being able to fully reopen until sometime in 2021, it would result in a loss of $9 billion in ticket sales alone. As long as bans on large gatherings continue, live performance revenue is almost zero, which effectively cuts the industry’s total revenue in half.</p>

			<p>“People are really overlooking what the entertainment industry is going through right now,” Rogue Theory bassist Hayes said. “All of us in the industry are kind of crossing our fingers that it will go back to the way it was.”</p>
